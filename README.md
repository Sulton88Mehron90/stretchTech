# PARKS PASSPORT


### **ABSTRACT**
This project was assigned as part of Turing School of Software Design module 3 front end. The main goal of the assignment was to learn a new technology independently outside of class. 

We chose TypeScript and built an app that connects to the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm).  
The goal of our app was to allow a user to explore national parks and save parks of interest.
